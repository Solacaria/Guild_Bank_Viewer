Run this before launching:<br>
`npm install`<br>


This is a small project i made for my guild to get a better interface for all guild bank info.<br>
Combined with an ingame addon to supply the data.<br>


<h1>How to use</h1><br>
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Install the addon: <br>
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Make sure to click all tabs at the bottom atleast once<br>
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Type "<i>/guilddatalist</i>" in chat <br>
<strong>Step 4:</strong> Copy the text that appears in the box <br>
<strong>Step 5:</strong> Paste it into the top-left text box on the website. <br>
<strong>Step 6:</strong> You can now read the data more easily. <br>

<h3>Good to know</h3>
<p>If you dont see any data in the <b>gold</b> table, you may have forgotten to click the gold tab ingame.<br> 
Simply click it, let it load and then proceed from step 3</p>
